\label{ch:conc}

We have covered a variety of applications of topic models focused on natural language, but no finite book could list all of the applications.

Other applications include biology~\cite{pritchard-00}, understanding source code~\cite{maskeri-08}, music analysis~\cite{hu-09}, and many more.

\section{The Future of Topic Models}
\label{sec:future}

Much of the research in topic models is in making inference more efficient~\cite{hoffman-10,zhai-12}.

Topic modeling is also blending with more expressive latent representation models~\cite{ranganath-15}.

\section{Automatic Text Analysis for the People}

However, the challenge is not to make these models and their inference more complicated but rather to make them more accessible.

This requires making the tools more usable.

But the output must also be understandable.

The outputs can be used as input into models or directly for human consumption.
