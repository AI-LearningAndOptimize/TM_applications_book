The review process for FnTIR is more collaborative than for other
journals.  We solicit papers, so our expectation is that the paper you
review will be published, in some form.  However, it needs to be an
excellent paper, so the reviewer's job is to assess quality, and to
make explicit suggestions about how to improve clarity, content,
breadth, etc.  We expect you to complete your review within 4 weeks,
for which you are paid a $100 honorarium.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Please fill out ALL of the fields indicated below by indicating a
score from 01 to 10 (01 is worst, 10 is best) and, #especially# by
adding constructive comments that may help the author(s) improve the
paper or help the editors-in-chief in making the final decision.  In
case of any doubt on how to fill out this form, please consult the
editors-in-chief.

If you own a copy of Adobe Acrobat, instead of filling in the
"Detailed comments to the author" section of the review, you may use
Adobe Acrobat's "annotation tool" to mark comments directly on the
.pdf file.  If you choose this option, be sure to return the annotated
.pdf file with your review.  Please use this option only for detailed
comments that are of interest to the authors but not to the editors.

Is this indeed a REVIEW/TUTORIAL paper?  Remember that FnTIR only publishes
papers of a review and/or tutorial nature, and is thus unsuitable for
publishing papers that are only or mainly focused on the authors' own
results. 

Please indicate a score from 01 to 10 here --> 7

Please add your comments on this:

Positive: The paper covers an extensive range of applications of topic
models and is a rich source of literature on these applications.

What can be improved: The style is very different across the different
chapters, sometimes being very didactic (e.g., chapter 1), sometimes
not (e.g., chapter 7). Also the level of detail and the explanations
are different across the chapters (e.g., chapter 4 compared to chapter
8). The authors should try to remedy this and write the publication in
a uniform and coherent style with a similar level of detail throughout
the chapters. Now, the publication is written in the style of an
edited book with different contributions by different authors.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

How IMPORTANT is the topic of the paper?  Would a review/tutorial paper on
this topic be an important tool for the IR community, or is the topic
already covered by some good, recent review/tutorial paper?  Is such a
topic in the scope of FnTIR, or is it too far removed from the concerns of
the IR community? 

Please indicate a score from 01 to 10 here --> 8

Please add your comments on this:

Positive: Overall a nice overview of the different applications is
given most of which are relevant for the IR community.

What can be improved: The chapter on multilingual data and machine
translation might be shortened as it is less relevant for the IR
community (e.g., the part on reordering with topic models). Instead
more emphasis should go to the use of topic models in cross-lingual
information retrieval and additional sections on mono/cross-lingual
categorization, mono/cross-lingual clustering and even the use of
topic models in cross-modal retrieval/categorization would strengthen
the review/tutorial.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

How WELL PRESENTED is the paper?  Does the paper read well?  Is the English
good?  Is the paper well-structured?  Is the mathematical notation
appropriate and consistent?  Does the paper introduce the notions required
to understand its content, so as to make it accessible to a "generic IR
researcher"?

Please indicate a score from 01 to 10 here --> 7

Please add your comments on this:

Positive: Most of the chapters are well and clearly written. 

What can be improved: As mentioned above the style and level of detail
should be more uniform over the chapters. Chapter 2 needs to be
revised.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

How COMPLETE is the paper?  Ideally, a complete paper on topic X should
address the main applications of X, the main approaches to X, evaluation
measures and standard benchmarks for X, publicly available resources for X,
and future trends.  Does the paper fail to address some such important
aspects of the topic?  Is the paper a thorough review of recent work, or
does it fail to quote important work in the area?

Please indicate a score from 01 to 10 here --> 6.5

Please add your comments on this:

Positive: As mentioned above the list of applications is already quite
extensive with the exception of a few.

What can be improved: The most important content that is missing from
the text is an in depth explanation on how to design, implement and
train topic models apart from the classical Hofmann - Blei type
generative architectures. The graphical models come in all shapes and
sizes and that is their power with regard to applications. Although in
chapter 7 reference is made to more complex topic models, the reader
could be better informed on how to build and train such models.  Some
important work is missing, which I indicated in the pdf.  Also at
other places indicated in the pdf, the authors miss earlier work on
specific subjects, methods or applications mentioned.  More
explanations of evaluation measures and addition of benchmarking test
collections would strengthen the work.  The section on future trends
could be more elaborate.

Is the paper CORRECT? Or does it contain significant technical mistakes?
Is the mathematics correct? 

Please indicate a score from 01 to 10 here --> 7.5

Please add your comments on this: 

The mathematics are correct, but the different chapters sometimes use
different symbols for the same variable, or the same symbol is used
with different meanings. The use of symbols should be more coherent
thought the work, perhaps by introducing a table with the most
important symbols in Chapter 1.  Also the technical and mathematical
details are quite different throughout the chapters as mentioned
above.

What is your final EVALUATION of this paper?  How strongly do you feel
that the paper should be accepted, or rejected?

Please indicate a score from 01 to 10 here --> 7

Please add your comments on this:

The work is certainly relevant to publish, but in its current state is
not yet ready for publication.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

How COMPETENT do you feel on the particular subject matter that the paper 
touches upon? Are you familiar with the most recent literature on it?

Please indicate a score from 01 to 10 here --> 9

Please add your comments on this:

I have a very good knowledge of topic models and on how to build,
train and apply them.

General comments to the authors:

See annotated pdf, especially annotations at the start of the chapters. 
I assume the above remarks are also sent to the authors.
