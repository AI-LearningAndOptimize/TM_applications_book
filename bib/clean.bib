		  data observed in earlier iterations to perform more
		  informative gradient-based learning. Metaphorically, the
		  adaptation allows us to find needles in haystacks in the
		  form of very predictive but rarely seen features. Our
		  paradigm stems from recent advances in stochastic
		  optimization and online learning which employ proximal
		  functions to control the gradient steps of the algorithm.
		  We describe and analyze an apparatus for adaptively
		  modifying the proximal function, which significantly
		  simplifies setting a learning rate and results in regret
		  guarantees that are provably as good as the best proximal
		  function that can be chosen in hindsight. We give several
		  efficient algorithms for empirical risk minimization
		  problems with common and important regularization functions
		  and domain constraints. We experimentally study our
		  theoretical analysis and show that adaptive subgradient
		  methods significantly outperform state-of-the-art, yet
		  non-adaptive, subgradient algorithms.}

      abstract	= {{This book describes the main objective of EuroWordNet,		  which is the building of a multilingual database with
		  lexical semantic networks or wordnets for several European
		  languages. Each wordnet in the database represents a
		  language-specific structure due to the unique
		  lexicalization of concepts in languages. The concepts are
		  inter-linked via a separate Inter-Lingual-Index, where
		  equivalent concepts across languages should share the same
		  index item. The flexible multilingual design of the
		  database makes it possible to compare the lexicalizations
		  and semantic structures, revealing answers to fundamental
		  linguistic and philosophical questions which could never be
		  answered before. How consistent are lexical semantic
		  networks across languages, what are the language-specific
		  differences of these networks, is there a
		  language-universal ontology, how much information can be
		  shared across languages? First attempts to answer these
		  questions are given in the form of a set of shared or
		  common Base Concepts that has been derived from the
		  separate wordnets and their classification by a
		  language-neutral top-ontology. These Base Concepts play a
		  fundamental role in several wordnets. Nevertheless, the
		  database may also serve many practical needs with respect
		  to (cross-language) information retrieval, machine
		  translation tools, language generation tools and language
		  learning tools, which are discussed in the final chapter.
		  <br/> The book offers an excellent introduction to the
		  EuroWordNet project for scholars in the field and raises
		  many issues that set the directions for further research in
		  semantics and knowledge engineering.}},

		  model predicts that bias will be less severe when consumers

		  news outlets can reduce bias. We present a variety of
		  empirical evidence consistent with these predictions.}

@book{gladwell-02,
      abstract	= {{"Why did crime in New York drop so suddenly in the		  mid-90s? How does an unknown novelist end up a bestselling
		  author? Why is teenage smoking out of control, when
		  everyone knows smoking kills? What makes TV shows like
		  Sesame Street so good at teaching kids how to read? Why did
		  Paul Revere succeed with his famous warning? In this
		  brilliant and groundbreaking book, New Yorker writer
		  Malcolm Gladwell looks at why major changes in our society
		  so often happen suddenly and unexpectedly. Ideas, behavior,
		  messages, and products, he argues, often spread like
		  outbreaks of infectious disease. Just as a single sick
		  person can start an epidemic of the flu, so too can a few
		  fare-beaters and graffiti artists fuel a subway crime wave,
		  or a satisfied customer fill the empty tables of a new
		  restaurant. These are social epidemics, and the moment when
		  they take off, when they reach their critical mass, is the
		  Tipping Point. <P>In The Tipping Point, Gladwell introduces
		  us to the particular personality types who are natural
		  pollinators of new ideas and trends, the people who create
		  the phenomenon of word of mouth. He analyzes fashion
		  trends, smoking, children's television, direct mail and the
		  early days of the American Revolution for clues about
		  making ideas infectious, and visits a religious commune, a
		  successful high-tech company, and one of the world's
		  greatest salesmen to show how to start and sustain social
		  epidemics. The Tipping Point is an intellectual adventure
		  story written with an infectious enthusiasm for the power
		  and joy of new ideas. Most of all, it is a road map to
		  change, with a profoundly hopeful message--that one
		  imaginative person applying a well-placed lever can move
		  the world."}},

      abstract	= {The minimum description length (MDL) principle is a		  powerful method of inductive inference, the basis of
		  statistical modeling, pattern recognition, and machine
		  learning. It holds that the best explanation, given a
		  limited set of observed data, is the one that permits the
		  greatest compression of the data. MDL methods are
		  particularly well-suited for dealing with model selection,
		  prediction, and estimation problems in situations where the
		  models under consideration can be arbitrarily complex, and
		  overfitting the data is a serious concern. This extensive,
		  step-by-step introduction to the MDL Principle provides a
		  comprehensive reference (with an emphasis on conceptual
		  issues) that is accessible to graduate students and
		  researchers in statistics, pattern classification, machine
		  learning, and data mining, to philosophers interested in
		  the foundations of statistics, and to researchers in other
		  applied sciences that involve model selection, including
		  biology, econometrics, and experimental psychology. Part I
		  provides a basic introduction to MDL and an overview of the
		  concepts in statistics and information theory needed to
		  understand MDL. Part II treats universal coding, the
		  information-theoretic notion on which MDL is built, and
		  part III gives a formal treatment of MDL theory as a theory
		  of inductive inference based on universal coding. Part IV
		  provides a comprehensive overview of the statistical theory
		  of exponential families with an emphasis on their
		  information-theoretic properties. The text includes a
		  number of summaries, paragraphs offering the reader a
		  \&quot;fast track\&quot; through the material, and boxes
		  highlighting the most important concepts.},

		  programming [Howard and Matheson, 1984; Shachter, 1986].
		  When the costs of computation are not negligible, the cost
		  of computing the optimal policy using dynamic programming
		  may be prohibitive. We have developed an algorithm which
		  can be used to compute policies for large multi-stage
		  decision problems under uncertainty represented as
		  influence diagrams. Our approach is incremental, and uses
		  abstraction. An influence diagram(ID) is a DAG representing
		  a sequential decision problem under uncertainty [Howard and
		  Matheson, 1984]. An ID models the subjective beliefs,
		  preferences, and available actions from the perspective of
		  a single decision maker. A decision tree represents a
		  decision function. The single stage information refinement
		  algorithm constructs a decision tree for a influence
		  diagram with a single decision node. A policy is
		  represented by a collection of decision trees, one for each
		  decision node in the influence diagram. A deterministic
		  decision tree is an inappropriate representation for a
		  decision function in a multi-stage policywhich is being
		  refined. For multi--stage decision problems, the refinement
		  may have ramifications for the global policy. Neither of
		  these complications occur for single-stage problems.},

		  data. Conditional random fields offer several advantages
		  over hidden Markov models and stochastic grammars for such
		  tasks, including the ability to relax strong independence
		  assumptions made in those models. Conditional random fields
		  also avoid a fundamental limitation of maximum entropy
		  Markov models (MEMMs) and other discriminative Markov
		  models based on directed graphical models, which can be
		  biased towards states with few successor states. We present
		  iterative parameter estimation algorithms for conditional
		  random fields and compare the performance of the resulting
		  models to HMMs and MEMMs on synthetic and natural-language
		  data. 1.},

		  foundations of dependency grammar and moving on to consider
		  both grammar-driven and data-driven methods for dependency
		  parsing. We will limit our attention to systems for
		  dependency parsing in a narrow sense, i.e. systems where
		  the analysis assigned to an input sentence takes the form
		  of a dependency structure. This means that we will not
		  discuss systems that exploit dependency relations for the
		  construction of another type of representation, such as the
		  head-driven parsing models of Collins (1997, 1999).
		  Moreover, we will restrict ourselves to systems for full
		  parsing, which means that we will not deal with systems
		  that produce a partial or underspecified representation of
		  dependency structure, such as Constraint Grammar parsers
		  (Karlsson, 1990; Karlsson et al., 1995).},

      abstract	= {An important part of our information-gathering behavior		  has always been to find out what other people think. With
		  the growing availability and popularity of opinion-rich
		  resources such as online review sites and personal blogs,
		  new opportunities and challenges arise as people can and
		  do, actively use information technologies to seek out and
		  understand the opinions of others. The sudden eruption of
		  activity in the area of opinion mining and sentiment
		  analysis, which deals with the computational treatment of
		  opinion, sentiment, and subjectivity in text, has thus
		  occurred at least in part as a direct response to the surge
		  of interest in new systems that deal directly with opinions
		  as a first-class object. Opinion Mining and Sentiment
		  Analysis covers techniques and approaches that promise to
		  directly enable opinion-oriented information-seeking
		  systems. The focus is on methods that seek to address the
		  new challenges raised by available resources, benchmark
		  datasets, and evaluation campaigns is also provided.
		  Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis is the first such
		  comprehensive survey of this vibrant and important research
		  area and will be of interest to anyone with sentiment-aware
		  applications, as compared to those that are already present
		  in more traditional fact-based analysis. The survey
		  includes an enumeration of the various applications, a look
		  at general challenges and discusses categorization,
		  extraction and summarization. Finally, it moves beyond just
		  the technical issues, devoting significant attention to the
		  broader implications that the development of
		  opinion-oriented information-access services have:
		  questions of privacy, vulnerability to manipulation and
		  whether or not reviews can have measurable economic impact.
		  To facilitate future work, a discussion of available
		  resources, benchmark datasets, and evaluation campaigns is
		  also provided. Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis is the
		  first such comprehensive survey of this vibrant and
		  important research area and will be of interest to anyone

      abstract	= {Language, whether spoken or written, is an important		  window into people's emotional and cognitive worlds. Text
		  analysis of these narratives, focusing on specific words or
		  classes of words, has been used in numerous research
		  studies including studies of emotional, cognitive,
		  structural and process components of individuals' verbal
		  and written language. It was in this research context that
		  the LIWC program was developed. The program analyzes text
		  files on a word-by-word basis, calculating percentage words
		  that match each of several language dimensions. Its output
		  is a text file that can be opened in any of a variety of
		  applications, including word processors and spreadsheet
		  programs. The program has 68 pre-set dimensions (output
		  variables) including linguistic dimensions, word categories
		  tapping psychological constructs and personal concern
		  categories and can accommodate user-defined dimensions as
		  well. Easy to install and use, this software offers
		  researchers in social, personality, clinical and applied
		  psychology a valuable tool for quantifying the rich but
		  often slippery data provided in the form of personal
		  narratives. The software comes complete on one diskette and
		  runs on any Windows-based computer.},

            abstract	= {{The key idea behind active learning is that a machine		  learning algorithm can achieve greater accuracy with fewer
		  labeled training instances if it is allowed to choose the
		  training data from which is learns. An active learner may
		  ask queries in the form of unlabeled instances to be
		  labeled by an oracle (e.g., a human annotator). Active
		  learning is well-motivated in many modern machine learning
		  problems, where unlabeled data may be abundant but labels
		  are difficult, time-consuming, or expensive to obtain. This
		  report provides a general introduction to active learning
		  and a survey of the literature. This includes a discussion
		  of the scenarios in which queries can be formulated, and an
		  overview of the query strategy frameworks proposed in the
		  literature to date. An analysis of the empirical and
		  theoretical evidence for active learning, a summary of
		  several problem setting variants, and a discussion of
		  related topics in machine learning research are also
		  presented.}},

		  lexical semantic networks or wordnets for several European
		  languages. Each wordnet in the database represents a
		  language-specific structure due to the unique
		  lexicalization of concepts in languages. The concepts are
		  inter-linked via a separate Inter-Lingual-Index, where
		  equivalent concepts across languages should share the same
		  index item. The flexible multilingual design of the
		  database makes it possible to compare the lexicalizations
		  and semantic structures, revealing answers to fundamental
		  linguistic and philosophical questions which could never be
		  answered before. How consistent are lexical semantic
		  networks across languages, what are the language-specific
		  differences of these networks, is there a
		  language-universal ontology, how much information can be
		  shared across languages? First attempts to answer these
		  questions are given in the form of a set of shared or
		  common Base Concepts that has been derived from the
		  separate wordnets and their classification by a
		  language-neutral top-ontology. These Base Concepts play a
		  fundamental role in several wordnets. Nevertheless, the
		  database may also serve many practical needs with respect
		  to (cross-language) information retrieval, machine
		  translation tools, language generation tools and language
		  learning tools, which are discussed in the final chapter.
		  <br/> The book offers an excellent introduction to the
		  EuroWordNet project for scholars in the field and raises
		  many issues that set the directions for further research in
		  semantics and knowledge engineering.}},

		  representation conditioned on both the topic and the
		  structure. In the resultant model each topic is equivalent
		  to a set of unigrams, reflecting the structure a word is
		  in. The proposed model is more flexible in modeling the
		  corpus. The factored representation prevents combinatorial
		  explosion and leads to efficient parameterization. We
		  derive the variational optimization algorithm for the new
		  model. The model shows improved perplexity on text and
		  image data, but no significant accuracy improvement when
		  used for classification.},
